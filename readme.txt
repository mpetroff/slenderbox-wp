== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does this plugin not work for me? =
* The problem is with your Wordpress theme mangling image code. Use another theme that doesn't interfere with image embedding.
* You have other plugins that conflict with Slenderbox; disable your other plugins and see if that helps. If it does, re-enable each plugin one at a time, to see which one is conflicting.
* There are possibly other reasons.
